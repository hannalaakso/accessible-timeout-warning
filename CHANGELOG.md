# Changelog

## Unreleased 3.0.0 (Breaking release)

See the [versioning documentation for how to update this
changelog](./docs/contributing/versioning.md#updating-changelog).

- Renamed css class names `js-character-count` and `js-header-toggle`

  Fixes issues with govuk-fronted javascript clashing with govuk-template/govuk-element and potentially other third-party javascript libraries using `js-` class names as hooks.

  HTML markup will only need to change if nunjucks macros are not being used.
  Update it use `govuk-js-character-count` or `govuk-js-header-toggle`.

  Eg. `<textarea class="govuk-textarea govuk-js-character-count"></textarea>`

  if you have any custom JavaScript relying on either `js-character-count` or `js-header-toggle`, you will
  need to update it use `govuk-js-character-count` or `govuk-js-header-toggle`.

  Eg. `document.querySelectorAll('.govuk-js-character-count')`
  Eg. `document.querySelectorAll('.govuk-js-header-toggle')`

  ([PR #1444](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/1444))

- Make radios and checkboxes components easier to link to from the error summary component

  You should check that clicking a link from the error summary to radios or checkboxes results in the first input being focused.

  The `id` of the first input in a set of radios or checkboxes will no longer be suffixed with `-1`. This means that it will be the same as your `idPrefix`, or if `idPrefix` is not set it'll be the same as the `name`.

  We've made this change to make it easier to link from the error summary to radios or checkboxes, if you we're working around this before by setting the first input's `item.id` to the same as the `name` you can now remove this.

  To migrate you can update your error summary so it links to the first element, for example if you are using an `idPrefix` option of `question`, your error summary can now link to `#question` instead of `#question-1`.

  If you cannot change your error summary, you could change your component to set the `item.id` option for the first input, for example:

  ```javascript
  {{ govukRadios({
    idPrefix: "question",
    name: "question",
    items: [
      {
        id: "question-1",
        value: "yes",
        text: "Yes"
      },
      {
        value: "no",
        text: "No"
      }
    ]
  }) }}
  ```

  ([PR #1426](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/1426))

- Update the font to v2

  The new version of the font is significantly smaller and its baseline has been
  optimised for the web, which means it's more consistent with other fonts.

  This means we can remove the adjustments that were previously required to
  vertically align text visually within boxes.

  For more details see the original issue logged by [@Nooshu](https://github.com/Nooshu) (https://github.com/alphagov/govuk_template/pull/357 & https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/issues/1012).

  The original version of the font is no longer included. If you're using GOV.UK
  Frontend alongside GOV.UK Template then the version of the font from GOV.UK
  Template will be used, as long as you've enabled [compatibility mode].

  To migrate: if you have any custom components you may want to check their vertical
  alignment

  ([PR #1434](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/1434))

- Remove `govuk-focusable`, `govuk-focusable-fill` mixins, introduce `govuk-focus-text` mixin.

  To migrate:

  For many use cases where `govuk-focusable-fill` was used you can now use `govuk-focused-text`.

  Before
  ```scss
  @include govuk-focusable-fill;
  ```

  After
  ```scss
  &:focus {
    @include govuk-focused-text;
  }
  ```

  For the `govuk-focusable` mixin, there is no general purpose mixin to replace this,
  please read the new [TODO focus how to guide on the Design System website](#[TODO]).

  ([PR #1361](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/1361))

- Update positioning on table headers and cells to help improve readability

  To migrate: If you rely on a centered certain vertical alignment, you could add
  a custom class to your application.

  ```css
  .app-table--vertical-align-middle .govuk-table__header,
  .app-table--vertical-align-middle .govuk-table__cell {
    vertical-align: middle;
  }
  ```

  ([PR #1345](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/1345))

- Update start now button to have styled icon when focused

  Without migrating, start buttons will lose their icon, to migrate:

  **If you are using the button Nunjucks macro**, you should:

  - add macro option `isStartButton` and set it to `true`
  - remove the class `.govuk-button--start`, as this is now automatically applied by the new option.

  For a full example see the [Nunjucks example on the Design System website](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/button/#start-buttons).

  **If you are using HTML**, you should update your HTML to include the new inline SVG, which can be found
  in the [HTML example on the Design System website](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/button/#start-buttons).

  ([PR #1315](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/1315))

- Rename `$govuk-border-width-mobile` to `$govuk-border-width-narrow`

  To migrate: If you are using `$govuk-border-width-mobile` in your own custom code, you need to rename any instances to `$govuk-border-width-narrow`.

  ([PR #1287](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/1287))

- The colour palette has been updated.

  **Note:** If you are using [compatibility mode], the existing palette will be
  preserved.

  Purple, red, yellow, green, blue and light blue have all been updated to new
  colours.

  Dark blue has been added, and bright red has been removed.

  Greys 1-through-4 have been replaced with dark, mid and light-grey. As a
  general rule of thumb, dark grey replaces grey-1 and is designed to be used as
  a foreground colour; light grey replaces both grey-3 and grey-4 and is
  designed to be used as a background colour, and mid-grey replaces grey-2 and
  is designed to be used for borders.

  To migrate you'll need to update any references to bright-red, grey-1, grey-2,
  grey-3 or grey-4 to use the new colours from the palette.

  ([PR #1288](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/1288))

- The button component now uses the green from the colour palette, instead of
  a custom green used only for the button.

  **Note:** If you are using [compatibility mode], the existing button colour
  will be preserved.

  ([PR #1288](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/1288))

- The confirmation panel now uses a green background rather than a turquoise
  background.

  **Note:** If you are using [compatibility mode], the existing turquoise panel
  colour will be preserved.

  ([PR #1288](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/1288))

- Links now get darker when hovered, rather than lighter.

  **Note:** If you are using [compatibility mode], the existing link hover style
  will be preserved.

  ([PR #1288](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/1288))

- Spacing of tabs list updated to be more inline with similar lists on GOV.UK and the Design System

  The tabs headings spacing has changed slightly on on mobile and when Javascript is disabled. See https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/1330#issuecomment-491233294

  To migrate: In the unlikely event that your app relies on the spacing of the tab headings being a certain height on mobile and with JS disabled, you should make the necessary adjustments in your code.

  ([PR #1330](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/1330))

- Removes `govuk-grid-row` mixin

  https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/1090 copied govuk-grid-row
  mixin to create a new concrete `.govuk-grid-row` class and marked the mixin as deprecated.

  To migrate you'll need to remove any references to `govuk-grid-row` mixin and use `.govuk-grid-row` class instead.

  ([PR #1343](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/1343))

- Remove grid-width mixin

  https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/1090 deprecated this mixin
  and left it in as an alias to govuk-grid-width.

  To migrate you'll need to replace any reference to the `grid-width` mixin with `govuk-grid-width`

  ([PR #1342](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/1342))

- Remove the deprecated `$class` parameter from the `@govuk-grid-column` mixin

  To migrate, you'll need to update any places in your code where you use the
  `@govuk-grid-column` mixin.

  If you are currently passing a class name (`$class: 'foo'`) you should remove
  the `$class` argument and wrap your call to the mixin in the class name
  instead:

  ```
  .foo {
    @include govuk-grid-column(...)
  }
  ```

  If you are currently passing `$class: false` then you can just remove the
  `$class` argument, as this is now the default behaviour.

  ([PR #1376](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/1376))

- Ensure GOV.UK Frontend component selectors cannot conflict when initialised

  Components which have JavaScript functionality include a data attribute called `[data-module]`,
  we have added the `govuk-` prefix as a namespace.

  This ensures the component's name does not conflict with other service level components
  with the same name, which is consistent with our CSS class name convention.

  If you're using Nunjucks macros, and are [using the `initAll` function](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/blob/master/docs/installation/installing-with-npm.md#option-1-include-javascript) you will not be affected.

  If you are using HTML, you will need to add the `govuk-` prefix to any `[data-module]` attributes.

  For example the accordion component selector has changed from `[data-module="accordion"]` to `[data-module="govuk-accordion"]`.

  ```html
  <div class="govuk-accordion" data-module="govuk-accordion">
    <!-- ... -->
  </div>
  ```

  If you are initialising components manually, you will need to add the `govuk-` prefix to any CSS selectors used to find GOV.UK Frontend components:

  ```javascript
  var $accordions = document.querySelector('[data-module="govuk-accordion"]')
  ```

  ([PR #1443](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/1443))

- Button and details components are now initialised consistently

  The button and details components now use the `[data-module]` selector to initialise them.

  If you're using Nunjucks macros, and are [using the `initAll` function](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/blob/master/docs/installation/installing-with-npm.md#option-1-include-javascript) you will not be affected.

  ### Button component

  The button component now is initialised with the `[data-module="govuk-button"]` selector instead of globally based on the document.

  If you are using HTML, you need to add the `[data-module="govuk-button"]` attribute to your buttons:

  ```html
  <button ... data-module="govuk-button">...</button>
  ```

  If you are initialising the button component manually, you will need to reference this `[data-module]` attribute:

  ```javascript
  var $buttons = document.querySelector('[data-module="govuk-button"]')
  ```

  ### Details component

  The details component now is initialised with the `[data-module="govuk-details"]` selector instead of `details` globally.

  If you are using the Nunjucks macro no changes is needed.

  If you are using HTML, you need to add the `[data-module="govuk-details"]` attribute to your details:

  ```html
  <details ... data-module="govuk-details">...</details>
  ```

  If you are initialising the button component manually, you will need to reference this `[data-module]` attribute:

  ```javascript
  var $details = document.querySelector('[data-module="govuk-details"]')
  ```

- Two unused images (`assets/images/icon-arrow-left.png` and
  `assets/images/icon-important.png`) have been removed.

  ([PR #1473](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/1473))

🆕 New features:

- IE 8 now falls back to Arial rather than Transport

  All of the browsers we support use the WOFF or WOFF2 fonts, except for IE 8
  which requires Embedded Open Type (.eot). The EOT version of the font is
  considerably larger, which impacts performance for users who are likely to be
  on older machines.

  Given IE8 only represents a very small percentage of traffic we get, we now
  fallback to Arial instead.

  Thanks to [@Nooshu](https://github.com/Nooshu) for their
  [recommendation to drop EOT files for older IE](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/1356#issuecomment-494727525).

- Checkboxes and radios use a new focus state with a thicker border. The
  transparent outline, previously required to show the focus state when custom
  colour schemes are used, has been removed.

  ([PR #1316](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/1316))

- A new setting `$govuk-use-legacy-palette` has been added, which by default
  will be true if any of the `$govuk-compatibility-*` settings are true.

  When set to `true`, the existing colour palette from v2.x of GOV.UK Frontend
  will be used.

  ([PR #1288](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/1288))

- The `govuk-colour` function has been updated to add a `$legacy` argument,
  which allows you to specify a colour (either a literal, or a name of a colour
  from the legacy palette) to use when `$govuk-use-legacy-palette` is true.

  ([PR #1288](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/1288))

- Table row headers (the first cell in each row when firstCellIsHeader is true)
  can now have additional classes, rowspan, colspan and additional attributes,
  in line with other table cells.

  Thanks to [Ed Horsford](https://github.com/edwardhorsford) for reporting.

  ([PR #1367](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/1367))

- Simplify `.govuk-main-wrapper` logic to avoid the need for large modifier in most cases.

  By using :first-child we can avoid the need for a modifier class, which is often missed.

  We are also deprecating mixins for main wrapper.
  We're not sure these are useful, so these will be removed in a future release, if you are using this please let us know: https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/issues/1379

🔧 Fixes:

- Removed adjustments that were needed for v1 Transport

  If v2 font is being used then there is no need for the adjustments that are currently used to compensate for the baseline issues of v1 Transport

  The following components were updated:
  - Back-link
  - Breadcrumbs
  - Button (mostly affected start button)
  - Header
  - Tags

  If v1 font is being used then the adjustments will still automatically be included in the compiled css.

  ([PR #1207](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/1207))

- Add new govuk-shade and govuk-tint functions for creating shades and tints of
  colours.

  ([PR #1207](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/1207))

- Add support for custom row classes on the summary list component (including support for some rows without action links)

  ([PR #1259](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/1259))

- Ensure fieldset never exceeds max-width

  This fix ensures that both WebKit/Blink and Firefox are prevented from expanding their fieldset widths to the content's minimum size.

  This was preventing `max-width: 100%` from being applied to select menus inside a fieldset.

  See discussion in ["Reset your fieldset"](https://thatemil.com/blog/2015/01/03/reset-your-fieldset/) and raised by [issue #1264](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/issues/1264)

  ([PR #1269](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/1269))

🔧 Fixes:

- Add various fixes to the summary list component:

  1. Fixes the 1px row height change when borders are removed
  Padding is now adjusted by 1px instead

  2. Fixes the text alignment when the actions column isn't added
  So the key column always stays at 30% width

  ([PR #1259](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/1259))

## 2.10.0 (Feature release)

🆕 New features:

- Add smaller versions of radio buttons and checkboxes

  Thanks to [@owenm6](https://github.com/owenm6) for their help and support on this one.

  ([PR #1125](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/1125))

🔧 Fixes:

- Prevent duplicate checkbox aria-describedby

  Addresses an edge case where a checkbox with a hint (but without a fieldset) is output with duplicate `aria-describeby` attributes. Fixes issue [#1248](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/1248).

  Thanks to [@colinrotherham](https://github.com/colinrotherham) for fixing this issue.

  ([PR #1265](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/1265))

## 2.9.0 (Feature release)

🆕 New features:

- Add classes to action items in the summary list component

  ([PR #1233](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/1233))

- Allow initAll to be scoped to a specific part of a page

  See ["Initialise GOV.UK Frontend in only certain sections of a page"](docs/installation/installing-with-npm.md#initialise-govuk-frontend-in-only-certain-sections-of-a-page) for more information.

  ([PR #1216](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/1216))

🔧 Fixes:

- Fix tabs bullet point character encoding issue when not enhanced

  Thanks [Ed Horsford](https://github.com/edwardhorsford) and [Steve Sims](https://github.com/stevesims) for their help on this one.

  ([PR #1247](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/1247))

- Update padding of govuk-main-wrapper

  This increases the padding of `govuk-main-wrapper` (on tablet and above) to be more inline with GOV.UK. When updating, your pages will have 10px more white space above and below the 'main' content area.

  ([PR #1073](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/1073))

- Remove error-summary dependence on document.onload

  ([PR #1215](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/1215))

- Ensure font is not loaded twice on slow networks

  This is only an issue for users that are using alphagov/govuk_template alongside GOV.UK Frontend.

  ([PR #1242](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/1242))

## 2.8.0 (Feature release)

### Considerations for fixed components such as modals

We have been made aware that the [change to force scroll bars to appear at all times](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/1230) can change the behaviour of some components such as modals.

If you're using your own components that rely on the overflow state of the document (such as modals) you should make sure you test those components when updating to this version.

🆕 New features:

- Enable `pattern` attribute for input

  You can now set the `pattern` attribute on input fields using the component
  macros:

  ```js
  {{ govukInput({
    name: "example",
    pattern: "[0-9]*"
  }) }}
  ```

  As well as `pattern`, custom attributes can also be added on day/month/year
  inputs (e.g. `data-example`) shown below:

  ```js
  {{ govukDateInput({
    items: [
      {
        pattern: "[0-9]*",
        attributes: {
          "data-example": "value"
        }
      }
    ]
  }) }}
  ```

  ([PR #1172](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/1172))

- Prevent horizontal jump as scrollbars appear

  As content vertical height grows (e.g. autocomplete results appear), browsers
  may add scroll bars causing the page to jump horizontally in position.

  To avoid this, re-introduce fix from GOV.UK Template:
  https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/issues/1204

  ([PR #1230](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/1230))


- Accommodate camera notches on new devices (iPhone X, Google Pixel 3 etc)

  On newer devices with "camera notches", browsers reserve a safe area in
  landscape orientation (known as pillarboxing) so content isn't obscured.

  To avoid this, support has been added for `viewport-fit=cover` as shown here:
  https://webkit.org/blog/7929/designing-websites-for-iphone-x/

  ([PR #1176](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/1176))


- Prefix error messages with a visually hidden "Error:", to make it clearer to
  users of assistive technologies

  ([PR #1221](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/1221))


- Prevent accidental multiple submissions of forms

  If a user double clicks a submit button in a form, we debounce this event and
  ignore the second click.

  HTML data attribute:

  ```html
  <button class="govuk-button" data-prevent-double-click="true">
    Submit
  </button>
  ```

  Nunjucks macro:

  ```js
  {{ govukButton({
    text: "Submit",
    preventDoubleClick: true
  }) }}
  ```

  ([PR #1018](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/1018))


🔧 Fixes:

- Ensure that files within the core, objects and overrides layers can be
  imported individually

  Unlike components, the files within these layers did not previously import
  their dependencies (for example, most of them require the govuk-exports mixin
  but did not import it).

  We've also added tests to ensure that files within these layers can be
  imported and rendered to CSS without erroring, which should catch this in the
  future.

  Thanks to [Alasdair McLeay](https://github.com/penx) for originally raising a
  PR to fix this.

  ([PR #1235](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/1235))


- Ensure inset component does not misalign nested components

  Thanks to [Paul Hayes](https://github.com/fofr) for raising this issue.

  ([PR #1232](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/1232))


- Improve word wrapping in summary list component

  Thanks to [Edward Horsford](https://github.com/edwardhorsford) and [Lee Kowalkowski](https://github.com/leekowalkowski-hmrc) for their help on this one.

  Also thanks to [Malcolm Butler](https://github.com/MoJ-Longbeard) for exploring a [previous version of this fix](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/1185).

  ([PR #1220](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/1220))


## 2.7.0 (Feature release)

🆕 New features:

- Added config file for prototype kit.

  Added a configuration file for an experimental feature in Prototype kit to allow departments to use their own frontend alongside govuk-frontend

  Thanks @matcarey (HMRC) for this contribution

  ([PR #1102](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/1102))

- Disable incorrect iOS/Edge text size adjustments

  To cater for non-responsive websites, iOS and Edge automatically increase font sizes (iOS in landscape, Edge in portrait on HiDPI displays).

  Since we have already considered typography at these device sizes, this feature is now turned off.

  ([PR #1178](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/1178))

🔧 Fixes:

- Fix wrapping of long lines of text in summary list

  Thanks to [@MoJ-Longbeard](https://github.com/MoJ-Longbeard) for raising the issue.

  ([PR #1169](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/1169))

## 2.6.0 (Feature release)

🆕 New features:

- Enable `autocomplete` attributes for input components.

  You can now set the `autocomplete` attribute on input, date input and textarea components using the component macros.

  This was already possible to do with the `attributes` option but this change highlights the new WCAG 2.1 success criteria [Identify Input Purpose](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/identify-input-purpose.html) which "is to ensure that the purpose of a form input collecting information about the user can be programmatically determined, so that user agents can extract and present this purpose to users using different modalities".

  See [autofill](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/form-control-infrastructure.html#autofill) for the full list of attributes that can be used.

  ([PR #1146](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/1146))

🔧 Fixes:

- Include Accordion component in global namespace

  Accordion component was not exported and was therefore unavailable in global namespace

  ([PR #1157](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/1157))

- Fix Checkboxes and Radios targeting selectors outside it's scope

  Thanks to [@andysellick](https://github.com/andysellick) and [@bilbof](https://github.com/bilbof) for helping us with this issue.

  ([PR #1156](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/1156))

- Fixes styling of the accordion component when there is no JavaScript or it has been turned off

  Thanks @dankmitchell for reporting this issue ([#1130](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/issues/1130))

  ([PR #1149](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/1149))

- Remove hover state for accordion sections on mobile

  ([PR #1148](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/1148))

- Fix container not being centered in IE8

  Since the header and the footer component use this container it also fixes centering for these components.

  ([PR #1147](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/1147))

- Make gutters in the header consistent with the grid

  This means that the header will now line up with the grid.

  Thanks to @edwardhorsford for raising this issue.

  ([PR #1144](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/1144))

## 2.5.1 (Fix release)

🔧 Fixes:

- Update summary list to simplify actions

  Only output actions in a list when there's multiple actions.

  ([PR #1131](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/1131))

## 2.5.0 (Feature release)

🆕 New features:

- Accordion component 🎉

  Contributed by @frankieroberto, as well as @injms, @hannalaakso, @joelanman and others.

  The accordion component lets users show and hide sections of related content on a page.

  For more information see [guidance](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/accordion/).

  ([PR #958](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/958))

- Add desktop specific grid column widths

  This allow you to define different grid behaviour for the tablet and desktop
  breakpoints. For example, you can make a column two-thirds on desktop but
  expand to full-width on smaller tablet sized screens.

  ([PR #1094](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/1094))

- Add summary list component

  This component was initially developed to allow us to build the
  'check your answers' pattern.

  It is mostly the same as in the original pattern with some notable differences:

  - On smaller screens it wraps by default
  - It's possible to have multiple actions

  ([PR #1065](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/1065))

🔧 Fixes:

- Update visually hidden class to fix ordering issue in VoiceOver OSX

  We have fixed an issue in VoiceOver OSX where using the `govuk-visually-hidden` class in links would result in the text being announced out of order.

  We also now recommend to use aria-label or aria-labelledby where appropriate.

  Thanks to @stevenaproctor and the accessibility team at HMRC for letting us know about this issue.

  ([PR #1109](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/1109))

- Improve rendering in older Internet Explorer

  Added a meta tag to ensure that older IE versions always render with the correct rendering engine

## 2.4.1 (fix release)

🔧 Fixes:

- Remove unused hint, error message and label imports from the Character Count
  component

  ([PR #1087](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/1087))

- Warning text component, remove negative margin left and reduce padding left to match.

  ([PR #1084](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/1084))

- Add 5px bottom margin to list items within lists that do not have bullets or
  numbers on mobile breakpoints to make each item visually distinct.

  ([PR #1078](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/1078))

- Add error message attributes to all components

  ([PR #1086](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/1086))

## 2.4.0 (Feature release)

🆕 New features:

- Scroll to label or legend when linked from error summary

  When users click links in the error summary, the corresponding label or legend
  will now be moved to the top of the viewport, rather than the input. This
  means that the context for the input remains on-screen.

  ([PR #1056](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/1056))

- Label or legend are announced for NVDA users when navigating to an input from
  the error summary

  ([PR #1056](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/1056))

- Allow form group classes on date, file upload, input, select and textarea

  All remaining form groups should allow additional classes, like with radios and checkboxes

  ([PR #1059](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/1059))

🔧 Fixes:

- Remove implicit dependency on Element for classList

  ([PR #1063](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/1063))

- Single field with error should have 'aria-describeby' attribute

  Although we discourage using checkboxes without fieldsets, this fix
  ensures that if there are no fieldset then the aria-describeby will
  still be usable by screenreaders by adding the element ids to the checkbox
  input elements 'aria-describeby' attribute.

  ([PR #1054](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/1054))

## 2.3.0 (Feature release)

🆕 New features:

- Add important parameter to visually hidden sass mixins

  Optional parameter added to `govuk-visually-hidden` and `govuk-visually-hidden-focusable` mixins (defaults to true)

  ([PR #1037](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/1037))

- Add support for attributes on table cells

  Can now use the familiar `attrubutes: {}` pattern to add various
  attributes such as `id` or `data-attr` to cells within tables

  ([PR #1045](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/1045))

- Allow form group classes on radios and checkboxes

  We now provide a way to add classes to the radio and checkbox form-group wrapper

  ([PR #1043](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/1043))

🔧 Fixes:

- Fix anchor links in tabs component panels

  ([PR #1031](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/1031))

- Fix IE8 support in builds in the `dist/` folder

  ([PR #1035](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/1035))

## 2.2.0 (Feature release)

🆕 New features:

- Allow classes on table header and row cells

  Optional classes attribute can now be used on table header and row cell item
  in the Nunjucks macro

  ([PR #1015](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/1015))

- Add character count component

  ([PR #959](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/959))


🔧 Fixes:

- Apply max-width to the `<select>` element

  The `<select>` element's width is governed by the widths of its `<option>`'s.

  When the text in the options grows large, the element can grow to > 100% of the width of its container and break the layout.

  ([PR #1013](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/1013))

- Prevent product name in header from wrapping

  Currently the product name in the header wraps when the space shrinks which doesn't look great.

  Adding `display: inline-table` prevents that so that the product name as a whole drops to a new line when space is shrunk.

  ([PR #1007](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/1007))

- Set text colour for radios divider

  ([PR 1023](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/1023))

- Stop links styled as button from being dragged

  Moving the mouse over a link while its button is depressed causes the
  browser’s dragging behaviour to trigger (and prevents the `click`
  event from firing). This is contrary to how actual `<button>` elements
  work. This pull request makes the behaviour of links styled as buttons
  consistent with that of buttons.

  ([PR #1020](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/1020))

## 2.1.0 (Feature release)

🆕 New features:

- Allow additional 'meta' content in the footer

  You can now pass additional 'meta' content (as `meta.html` or `meta.text`)
  which will appear below any meta links, above the OGL license. This is ideal
  for, for example, the 'Built by Department Name' colophon.

  ([PR #990](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/990))

- Allow attributes to be added to some child items in header, footer, breadcrumbs, tabs and error-summary components

  You can now pass additional attributes to links in header, footer, breadcrumbs, tabs and error-summary components

  ([PR #993](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/993))

- Fix issue with conditional form content and inline form controls

  When inline variant of form controls is used with conditional content, we force
  it to display block. This is to avoid breaking and confusing styling as it is
  a combination we don't recommend.

  ([PR #970](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/970))

- Add component options (arguments) as `macro-options.json` to `package`

  We want to be able to expose these options to GOV.UK Design System. This change includes them as `yaml` in `src/components` and adds a build step to transform them to `JSON` and copy them to `package/components`. It also adds a test to check if the copied files are valid JSON and contain expected attributes.

  ([PR #998](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/998))

🔧 Fixes:

- Fix mobile menu button submitting parent forms

  The menu `<button>` didn’t have an explicit `type` set, which meant that it
  defaulted to `type=“submit”`.

  This meant that if the header was inside a form (as it is in the Design System
  examples, but we can imagine other scenarios where this would be the case)
  clicking the menu button would submit the form.

  In most cases this would also cause the page to reload, which closes the menu.

  ([PR #994](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/994))

- Fix flash of unstyled content in tabs component

  ([PR #1000](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/1000))

- Add 48px favicon

  Microsoft recommends including at least a 48x48px favicon.

  ([PR #986](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/986))

- Update `browsersList` in `package.json` to reflect our supported browsers

  `browsersList` is used by PostCSS in our current build to determine which browser prefixes or rules to generate for the built CSS files. This PR adds rules to specify that the browsers in our [browser matrix](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend#browser-support) should always be prefixed for. Additionally, any browser with more than 0.1% of the global market share is prefixed for.

  In terms of changes to our built CSS, this means that `-webkit-box-sizing` and `-webkit-box-shadow` prefixes will be removed - neither of these prefixes are required by desktop Safari 5.1 or later so this seems a fairly safe change to make.

  ([PR #1002](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/1002))

## 2.0.0 (Breaking change)

💥 Breaking changes:

- Set panel component's title heading level to 1 as default

  We think the panel title should be the h1 in the majority of cases, so we made
  it the default.

  If you have need to change the Panel component heading to something other than
  h1, you can do so by specifying `headingLevel: <number>` in the Nunjucks
  macro.

  ([PR #967](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/967))

- Remove deprecated `govuk-visually-hidden-focussable` class name

  In 1.1 release we added a new, correctly spelt
  `govuk-visually-hidden-focusable` CSS class and marked the old one as
  deprecated.

  To migrate you need to change `govuk-visually-hidden-focussable` to
  `govuk-visually-hidden-focusable` in your codebase.

  ([PR #968](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/968))

- Remove name-based width logic from date-input component

  In [1.1 release](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/857/files#diff-e94394b2ac1d4f73991af98e4fa34fa3L32)
  we removed styling which made the year field 4 characters wide, but was
  coupled to the field's name.

  However, to avoid making this a breaking release, we added logic to
  automatically add the width classes based on the name.

  We are now removing this behaviour. Instead, users need pass explicit classes
  for each field in the `items` object for the desired width of the input field.

  If you are not passing items at all, you will get the default items which include these classes.

  If you are using the Nunjucks macro, you need to provide a width class for
  each item, for example:

  ```
  {{ govukDateInput({
    "id": "dob",
    "name": "dob",
    "fieldset": {
      "legend": {
        "text": "What is your date of birth?"
      }
    },
    "items": [
      {
        "name": "day",
        "classes": "govuk-input--width-2"
      },
      {
        "name": "month",
        "classes": "govuk-input--width-2"
      },
      {
        "name": "year",
        "classes": "govuk-input--width-4"
      }
    ]
  }) }}
  ```

  If you are using plain HTML, you need to manually add a width-based class, such
  as  `govuk-input--width-2` or `govuk-input--width-4` to the input fields.

  ([PR #969](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/969))

- Rename `name` argument of date-input component to `namePrefix`.

  This is better reflective of the purpose of the argument, which is to prefix the `name` attribute of `items`. This is consistent with other components which use the name `idPrefix` to explain similar functionality.

  If your project currently uses this optional argument with the date-input macro, you need to rename all instances of it to `namePrefix` (NB: this argument shouldn't be confused with the `items.{}.name` attribute which hasn't changed.)

  ([PR #984](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/984))

- Turn off [compatibility mode](./docs/installation/installing-with-npm.md#compatibility-mode) by default for [GOV.UK Elements](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk_elements), [GOV.UK Template](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk_template), [GOV.UK Frontend Toolkit](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk_frontend_toolkit)

  You do not need to make any changes if you do not use these projects alongside GOV.UK Frontend.

  To migrate include the SCSS variables that correspond with the projects you depend on before importing GOV.UK Frontend styles into your app:

  ```SCSS
  // application.scss
  $govuk-compatibility-govukfrontendtoolkit: true;
  $govuk-compatibility-govuktemplate: true;
  $govuk-compatibility-govukelements: true;
  @import "govuk-frontend/all";
  ```
  ([PR #981](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/981))

- Turn on relative typography (rem) by default

  This allows for end-users to adjust GOV.UK Frontend components by setting their font size in their browser.

  If you are using GOV.UK Frontend on with no other frameworks this should not break your project.

  If you need to change this setting for compatibility with [GOV.UK Elements](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk_elements), [GOV.UK Template](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk_template), [GOV.UK Frontend Toolkit](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk_frontend_toolkit) consider enabling [compatibility mode](./docs/installation/installing-with-npm.md#compatibility-mode).

  Otherwise, set `$govuk-typography-use-rem` to `false` before importing GOV.UK Frontend styles into your app:
  ```SCSS
  // application.scss
  $govuk-typography-use-rem: false;
  @import "govuk-frontend/all";
  ```
  ([PR #981](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/981))

- Remove anchor styling in govuk-lists

  This was an undocumented feature of lists.

  To migrate we recommend using adding `.govuk-link` class to any anchors within a govuk-list.

  If you would like to replicate this functionality without adding a class you can also enable [global styles](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/blob/master/docs/installation/installing-with-npm.md#global-styles) (Note: global styles are enabled by default in the GOV.UK Prototype Kit)

  ([PR #985](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/985))

- Remove the width declaration from the `<select>` component

  The `<select>` component’s width will now be defined by it’s content. This addresses some accessibility issues with the select being 100% wide by default. If you want to style your select to be 100% wide we have added a new override class `.govuk-!-width-full` to allow this.

  ([PR #960](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/960))

- Use text colour on focus for better contrast

  Updates the focus styles of links in GOV.UK Frontend so they pass WCAG contrast requirements.

  ([PR #982](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/982))

🆕 New features:

- Add a new width override class `.govuk-!-width-full`

  You can now override elements that have an undefined or smaller percentage  width to be 100% width of their container.

  ([PR #960](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/960))

- Allow attributes on select items

  You can now provide attributes on select items
  `attributes: { 'data-attribute': 'value' }`

  ([PR #977](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/977))

🔧 Fixes:

- Textareas can now only be resized vertically, to prevent them being resized
  outside of their container bounds. Additionally, they now have a minimum
  height to prevent them being resized smaller than a text input.

  ([PR #976](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/976))

- Defend tables against GOV.UK Elements code
  ([PR #983](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/983))

  Margin is only added when panel text is provided

  ([PR #936](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/936))

- Remove template whitespace

  Remove leading whitespace before the doctype in the page template.
  Some older browser will be forced into 'quirks mode' if there is whitespace before the doctype.

  ([PR #949](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/949))

- Remove additional dotted outline from focussed buttons in Firefox

  This was already the intended behaviour, but a minor typo (: rather than ::)
  meant that it wasn't being applied.

  ([PR #951](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/951))

- Update date input component to use `display: inline-block`
  ([PR #938](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/938))

- Only underline the logo in the header on underline when users have overridden
  colours in their browser, rather than it appearing underlined all the time

- Allow for optional hint for each radio and checkbox item

  You can now pass a hint object (or add in html) to each radio
  and checkbox item to display the hint
  ([PR #846](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/846))

- Allow additional classes to be added to the radio and checkbox items

  You can now provide `label: { classes: 'extra-class' }` to each item.

  ([PR #880](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/880))

🔧 Fixes:

- Replace conflicting `js-hidden` class used within the tabs component with a new modifier class.
  Because this class is defined and used within the JavaScript, no markup changes are required.
  ([PR #916](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/916))
- Use `get-function` when calling a Sass function as passing a string to `call()``
  is deprecated and will be illegal in Sass 4.0
  ([PR #919](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/919))

- Fix flash of unstyled content with conditional reveals (Radios and Checkboxes)

  If the conditional reveal JavaScript is slow to execute it can result in showing the user their contents briefly which can be jarring.

  ([PR #885](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/885))

  ([PR #886](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/886))

- Fixes an issue where clicking the revealed content in browsers that do not
  support the native details element causes the details element to collapse.
  ([PR #912](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/912))

- Fixes an issue where clicking the revealed content within a details element
  toggles the aria-expanded attribute on the summary element and the aria-hidden
  attribute on the content element, causing them to get out of sync with the
  visible state of the component.
  ([PR #912](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/912))

- Fixes an issue where it's not possible to make any field that does not have
  the name ‘year’ use any other width than 2 characters
  ([PR #908](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/908))

- Fix undefined class displaying in date input
  ([PR #913](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/913))

## 1.1.0 (feature release)

🆕 New features:

  Adds `.govuk-visually-hidden-focusable` and deprecates `.govuk-visually-hidden-focussable` in order to fix the typo in the class name. Please consider updating your code as the next major release will remove the deprecated class.

  ([PR #859](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/859))

- Allow panel component title heading to be customisable.

  You can now specify a heading level by providing
  `headingLevel: <number>` parameter. Default is `2`.
  ([PR #853](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/853))

- Update date input component

  Allow the `name` and `id` attributes to be passed individually for each input item.

  Rely on `classes` instead of item names to set the width of input items.

  Add default (day, month, year) date input items if no items are being specified

  ([PR #857](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/857))

- The typography scale can now be converted from pixels to rem automatically,
  with pixels also being provided as a fallback for older browsers.

  This feature is disabled by default - in order to use it you will need to set
  `$govuk-typography-use-rem: true` and ensure that `$govuk-root-font-size` is
  set to the effective size of your root (html) element. For new projects, this
  should be the default of 16px so you don't have to do anything. For projects
  that use alphagov/govuk_template this should be 10px.

  The intention is to enable this by default in the next major version:
  https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/issues/868

  ([PR #858](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/858))


🔧 Fixes:

- Remove mistakenly applied 5px bottom margin from radio and checkbox
  labels.
  ([PR #883](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/883))

- Apply `display:block` to `.govuk-main-wrapper`

  In IE11 `main` element is set to `display:inline` so padding
  and margins aren't applied.
  ([PR #863](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/863)))

- Line-heights are now converted from pixels to relative 'unit-less' values
  in order to prevent issues when resizing text in the browser.
  ([PR #837](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/837) and
   [PR #848](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/848))

- Add bottom margin to Tabs component
  All components (or outer layer components) have a bottom margin
  applied to them so spacing feels automatic.
  ([PR #841](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/841))

- Update Crown copyright link
  Update the Crown copyright link on the National Archives so
  we don't send users on an unnecessary redirect.
  ([PR #824](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/824))

- Fixes radio and checkbox labels extending full width of page
  ([PR #821](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/821))

- Prevent the exclamation mark in the warning text component from being
  selectable, which also excludes it when it is copied as part of a wider body
  of text
  ([PR #856](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/856))

- Add customised colours handling for warning text

  By adding a border to this component, when a user customises their colour settings
  they will still see a circle even if the background is removed.
  ([PR #852](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/852))

- Fixes a bug where the phase banner incorrectly uses a font-size of 19px when
  global styles are enabled
  ([PR #877](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/877))

- Add outlines to Radios and Checkboxes for customised colour users

  Now when a [user customises their colours](https://accessibility.blog.gov.uk/2017/03/27/how-users-change-colours-on-websites/),
  they should see a focus state on both Radios and Checkboxes.
  ([PR #854](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/854))

- Add outline to tag for customised colour users

  Now when a [user customises their colours](https://accessibility.blog.gov.uk/2017/03/27/how-users-change-colours-on-websites/),
  the tag component still keeps it's meaning.
  ([PR #855](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/855))

- Define size of table in `px` rather than `em`

  This brings the styling of tables inline with rest of GOV.UK Frontend which no longer uses `em` for measurements.

  This change very slightly increases the padding of table cells on mobile viewport as the use of `em` meant the font size set in the table was used to calculate padding. `padding-top` and `padding-bottom` of cells increase by 1.5px respectively which very slightly increases the height of the table on mobile.

  In the unlikely case that your UI has a dependency on tables being a certain fixed height of mobile viewport, this change might affect you.

  ([PR #845](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/845))

- Fix header component's reliance on markup whitespace

  We have had issues where the header component can render incorrectly if the markup contains whitespace,
  for example if it has been pretty printed.

  This changes the header component to use float based columns similar to how the grid system works.

  ([PR #884](httqps://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/884))

🔧 Fixes:

- Reduce margin-bottom on the hint when following a default or small labe
  This reduces the margin-bottom of the hint by 5px after a default
  `<label>` or `<label class="govuk-label--s">`.

## 0.0.32 (Breaking release)

**This release changes the name of package.** It's now published as `govuk-frontend` on `npm`.

💥 Breaking changes:

- The default build of the GOV.UK Frontend JavaScript now does not initialize all components automatically.

  This allows you to initialize only the components you need, and gives you finer control over when the JavaScript for GOV.UK Frontend runs.

  To migrate your project you need to change
  ```html
    <script src="{path-to-govuk-frontend}/all.js"></script>
  ```
  to
  ```html
    <script src="{path-to-govuk-frontend}/all.js"></script>
    <script>window.GOVUKFrontend.initAll()</script>
  ```

  Now, if you only want to initialize a specific component you can now do so by:
  ```html
    <script src="{path-to-govuk-frontend}/all.js"></script>
    <script>
      var Button = window.GOVUKFrontend.Button
      new Button(document).init()
    </script>
  ```

  Note: If you are importing JavaScript with a bundler, this is not likely to change anything for you.
  ([PR #759](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/759))

- Consistently structure the Details and Button component, so that they can be instantiated the same as the other components.

  If you're using `GOVUKFrontend.initAll()` you do not need to make any changes, otherwise you need to change
  ```html
    <script>
      new Button().init()
      new Details().init()
    </script>
  ```
  to
  ```html
    <script>
      new Button(document).init()

      var $details = document.querySelectorAll('details')
      nodeListForEach($details, function ($detail) {
        new Details($detail).init()
      })
    </script>
  ```
  ([PR #761](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/761))

- All sass-mq settings have now been made private. We are now exposing new
  settings to allow you to customise breakpoints and responsive behaviour:

  - `$govuk-breakpoints` - Map of breakpoint definitions
  - `$govuk-show-breakpoints` - Whether to show the current breakpoint in the
    top right corner
  - `$govuk-ie8-breakpoint` - Breakpoint to rasterize to for IE8

  If you are overriding any settings prefixed with `$mq-` in your application
  you will need to update to the use the new `$govuk-` prefixed settings.

  ([PR #748](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/748))

- Font settings have been renamed:

  - `$govuk-font-stack` has been renamed to `$govuk-font-family`
  - `$govuk-font-stack-tabular` has been renamed to `$govuk-font-family-tabular`
  - `$govuk-font-stack-print` has been renamed to `$govuk-font-family-print`

  ([PR #748](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/748))

- Spacing has been refactored. You will need to update Sass that currently uses GOV.UK Frontend spacing:

  - Instead of
  ``` css
  $govuk-spacing-scale-*
  ```
  use
  ``` css
  govuk-spacing(*)
  ```
  where `*` is the number on the spacing scale. The scale itself has remained the same so that `$govuk-spacing-scale-3` corresponds to `govuk-spacing(3)`. This change allows us to control the error messaging when incorrect values are used and to deprecate variables. The values of spacing variables can also be overridden by consumers.

  - Instead of:
  ``` css
  @include govuk-responsive-margin($govuk-spacing-responsive-2, "bottom");
  @include govuk-responsive-padding($govuk-spacing-responsive-2, "bottom");
  ```
  use
  ``` css
  @include govuk-responsive-margin(2, "bottom");
  @include govuk-responsive-padding(2, "bottom");
  ```
  This change, again, allows us to control the error messaging since spacing variables are not exposed directly. Also, the spacing scale itself has not changed so that `$govuk-spacing-responsive-2` corresponds to `2` when passed to the padding and margin mixins.

  This PR also updates tests and sass-docs of spacing variables and helpers.

  Additionally, this PR hardcodes the value of `$govuk-gutter`, see PR for more details.

  ([PR #779](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/779))

- Remove `pageStart` block from template, as could result in rendering issues in older IE.
  ([PR #765](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/765))

- You should no longer call the `mq` mixin directly - you should replace any
  calls to it from your own code with `govuk-media-query` which accepts the same
  arguments. All mixins and settings that start with `mq-` should be considered
  private – they could be removed in the future without notice.
  ([PR #763](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/763))

- All of the shorthand 'font' mixins (e.g. `govuk-font-bold-80`,
  `govuk-font-regular-tabular-19`), have been removed and replaced with calls to
  a new mixin `govuk-font`. If you are using these mixins in your application
  you will need to update your code to call `govuk-font` instead.

  ([PR #772](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/772))

- The font maps are no longer as individual variables (e.g. `$govuk-font-80`) -
  they are all now part of one single `$govuk-typography-scale` map. Instead of
  passing font maps to `govuk-typography-responsive` you should now pass the
  desktop font size (e.g. `govuk-typography-responsive(80)` or
  `govuk-typography-responsive($size: 80)`.

  ([PR #772](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/772))

- All organisation variables (e.g. `$govuk-cabinet-office`) have been moved into
  a single `$govuk-colours-organisations` map. If you need to use an
  organisation colour in your own code, you should use the new
  `govuk-organisation-colour` function:

  ```scss
  .element {
    color: govuk-organisation-colour(cabinet-office);
  }
  ```

  Note that this function will return 'web-safe' colours by default. You can
  pass $websafe: false to get the non-websafe colour.

- The colour palette variables (e.g. `$govuk-green`) have been moved into a
  new single `$govuk-colours` map. If you need to reference a colour within your
  application you should use the new `govuk-colour` function:

  ```scss
  .element {
    color: govuk-colour("green");
  }
  ```

  Tints (`$govuk-green-50`, `$govuk-green-25`) have been removed from the colour
  palette.

- A number of the colours have been renamed to use more neutral names:

  - `mauve` → `light-purple`
  - `fuchsia` → `bright-purple`
  - `baby-pink` → `light-pink`
  - `mellow-red` → `bright-red`
  - `grass-green` → `light-green`

- The 'circle shape' object (`.govuk-circle`) which was used by the warning text
  component's '!' icon has been removed and the `govuk-warning-text__icon` class
  has been updated to make it circular without the need for another class.

  ([PR #782](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/782))
- Removal of `govuk-prose-scope`
  We don't have confidence that the prose scope is well understood –
  without further research / better documentation it's safer to remove it for now.

  If you are currently using prose-scope, you should revert to applying classes to
  individual headings, lists and hr elements.
  In version [0.0.29-alpha](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/releases/tag/v0.0.29-alpha)
  release we have added the option to enable global link and paragraph styles.

  If you're using a recent version of the Private Beta Prototype kit,
  this is enabled by default.

  ([PR #778](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/778))

- Make override classes consistently verbose
  Based on [feedback from the community](https://gist.github.com/nickcolley/f135e89ed4b679355b0ab47135b38ee8)
  we have made the override classes consistent where previously some where verbose and some where shorthand.

  We've made the decision to remove the 'r' for responsive, this was hard to remember and users found this confusing.

  To migrate you will need to replace any instances of:

  - `.govuk-!-f-{size}` with `.govuk-!-font-size-{size}`
  - `.govuk-!-w-{weight}` with `.govuk-!-font-weight-{weight}`
  - `.govuk-!-m{direction}-r{scale}` with `.govuk-!-margin-{direction}-{scale}`
  - `.govuk-!-p{direction}-r{scale}` with `.govuk-!-padding-{direction}-{scale}`

  For example if you were using:
  - `.govuk-!-mb-r5` you would need to change this to `.govuk-!-margin-bottom-5`
  - `.govuk-!-f-24` you would need to change this to `.govuk-!-font-size-24`

  See the original Pull Request for the full list of classes before and after.

💥 Breaking changes:

- The `govuk-file-url` helper has been renamed to to `govuk-image-url`. If you

🆕 New features:

- Change font delivery method from Base64 encoded strings to serving WOFF2, WOFF
  and EOT files as separate HTTP requests. You will need to ensure that you are
  serving the fonts from the assets folder as part of your application.
  ([PR #726](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/726))

- The font-face is now using `font-display: fallback`. This means that the
  fallback font (Arial) will be used if NTA doesn't download within 100ms. The
  browser will then swap to NTA as long as it loads within the short swap period.
  ([PR #726](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/726))

- You can now override the helpers used to generate image and font urls, for
  example if you are using sass-rails' asset-pipeline functionality.
  You can do this by setting `$govuk-image-url-function` and
  `$govuk-font-url-function` to the name of the function(s) you wish to use.
  See `src/settings/_assets.scss` for more information and examples.

## 0.0.29-alpha (Breaking release)

💥 Breaking changes:

- Restructure project to enable it to be published as a single package

  The [new project structure]((./src/README.md)) matches our ITCSS inspired layers and is published as a single package as `@govuk-frontend/frontend`.

  You will need to:

  - Update your npm dependencies to use `@govuk-frontend/frontend`
  - Update your SCSS import paths to match the new package name and folder structure.

  If you're importing everything at once:

  ```CSS
  @import "node_modules/@govuk-frontend/frontend/all";
  ```

  If you're importing individual components:

  ```CSS
  @import "node_modules/@govuk-frontend/frontend/components/button/button";
  ```

  See the [main README](./README.md) for up-to-date installation instructions.

  ([PR #680](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/680))

- Error Messages and Hints have been moved out Label and Fieldset components.

  They are no longer nested within the label or legend.
  They are associated with the input or with the fieldset using aria-describedby.

  Hint has been made into a new component similar to Error Message.

  If you're using markup, you will need to update the old markup:

  ```HTML
  <label class="govuk-c-label" for="national-insurance-number">
    National Insurance number
    <span class="govuk-c-label__hint">
      It’s on your National Insurance card, benefit letter, payslip or P60. For example, ‘QQ 12 34 56 C’.
    </span>
    <span class="govuk-c-error-message">
      Error message goes here
    </span>
  </label>
  <input class="govuk-c-input govuk-c-input--error" id="national-insurance-number" name="national-insurance-number" type="text">
  ```

  With the new markup:

  ```HTML
  <label class="govuk-label" for="national-insurance-number">
    National Insurance number
  </label>
  <span id="national-insurance-number-hint" class="govuk-hint">
    It’s on your <i>National Insurance card</i>, benefit letter, payslip or P60. For example, ‘QQ 12 34 56 C’.
  </span>
  <span id="national-insurance-number-error" class="govuk-error-message">
    Error message goes here
  </span>
  <input class="govuk-input govuk-input--error" id="national-insurance-number" name="test-name-3" type="text" aria-describedby="national-insurance-number-hint national-insurance-number-error">
  ```

  If you're using macros:

  The fieldset macro no longer accepts `legendHintText` or `legendHintHtml` -
  these parameters are now passed to the hint component which accepts `text` or
  `html`. The date-input, checkboxes and radios components have been updated to
  use the new Hint component.

  The label macro no longer accepts `hintText` or `hintHtml` - these parameters
  are now passed to the hint component which accepts `text` or `html`. The
  file-upload, input, select and textarea components have been updated to use the
  new Hint component.

  For example, this example macro call for a File Upload component:

  ```njk
  {{ govukFileUpload({
    "id": "file-upload",
    "name": "photo",
    "label": {
      "text": "Upload your photo",
      "hintText": "Your photo may be in your Pictures, Photos, Downloads or Desktop folder."
    }
  }) }}
  ```

  would now be:

  ```njk
  {{ govukFileUpload({
    "id": "file-upload",
    "name": "photo",
    "label": {
      "text": "Upload your photo"
    },
    "hint": {
      "text": "Your photo may be in your Pictures, Photos, Downloads or Desktop folder."
    }
  }) }}
  ```

  For more examples of the new markup and Nunjucks macros see the GOV.UK Design System [Question Pages pattern](https://govuk-design-system-production.cloudapps.digital/patterns/question-pages/)

  ([PR #681](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/681))

- The date-input component now sets an explicit `group` role on the fieldset
  to force JAWS 18 to announce the error message and hint.
  ([PR #681](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/681))

- The label component macro now accepts an `isPageHeading` argument which determines
  whether the label itself should be wrapped in an h1:

  ```html
  <h1 class="govuk-label-wrapper">
    <label class="govuk-label">What is your National Insurance number?</label>
  </h1>
  ```

  The `.govuk-label-wrapper` removes the margins from the heading so that the
  presence of the `h1` has no effect on the styling of the label.

  ([PR #684](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/684))


- Added new modifier classes for labels to allow you to create a label that
  visually corresponds to the equivalent heading class (for example, a
  `.govuk-label--xl` will have the same font size and weight as a
  `.govuk-heading-xl`)

  ([PR #684](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/684))


- The arguments for a fieldset's legend have been rolled up into an object. For
  example, the following macro call:

  ```
  {{ govukFieldset({
    legendText: "What is your date of birth?"
  }) }}
  ```

  would now be:

  ```
  {{ govukFieldset({
    legend: {
      text: "What is your date of birth?"
    }
  }) }}
  ```

  The `legend` object can also accept new `classes` and `arguments`

  Components that use the fieldset component have been updated to reflect these
  changes.

  ([PR #684](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/684))


- The fieldset component has a new parameter legend.isPageHeading, which defines
  whether the legend text should be wrapped in an h1:

  ```html
  <legend class="govuk-fieldset__legend">
    <h1 class="govuk-fieldset__heading">Have you changed your name?</h1>
  </legend>
  ```

  The `.govuk-fieldset__heading` class ensures that the `<h1>` inherits its
  properties from the legend, so that the presence of the `h1` has no effect on
  its styling.

  ([PR #684](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/684))


- Added new modifier classes for legends to allow you to create a legend that
  visually corresponds to the equivalent heading class (for example, a
  `.govuk-fieldset__legend--xl` will have the same font size and weight as a
  `.govuk-heading-xl`)

  ([PR #684](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/684))

- Remove -c -o -h layer prefixes
  ([PR #644](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/644))
  In user research and in feedback from Private Beta partners we
  learned that users didn't really understand what -o, -c and -h prefixes
  stand for or why they're useful.

  They also introduced additional cognitive load when composing classes,
  having to remember which suffix the classname contains.

  If you're using markup, you will need to:
  - Remove -o, -c and -h prefixes from class names in your markup

  For example, change:
  ```HTML
  <button class="govuk-c-button">Save and continue</button>
  ```

  Into:

  ```HTML
  <button class="govuk-button">Save and continue</button>
  ```

- Simplify grid syntax and introduce grid-row and column mixins.

  Based on user research feedback we have simplified the grid classes
  to a more concise naming structure.

  You will need to:
  - Change grid class names in your markup

  For example, change:
  ```HTML
  <div class="govuk-o-grid">
    <div class="govuk-o-grid__item govuk-o-grid__item--two-thirds">
      <!-- content -->
    </div>
    <div class="govuk-o-grid__item govuk-o-grid__item--one-third">
      <!-- content -->
    </div>
  </div>
  ```

  Into:

  ```HTML
  <div class="govuk-grid-row">
    <div class="govuk-grid-column-two-thirds">
      <!-- content -->
    </div>
    <div class="govuk-grid-column-one-third">
      <!-- content -->
    </div>
  </div>
  ```

  We have also introduced two mixins
  to help generate additional or custom grid styles and widths,
  see original pull request for usage.

  Global styles are not included by default.

  This is to avoid the risk of these globals conflicting with any pre-existing globals, for example in GOV.UK Elements or GOV.UK Template.

  Hovever, we do include them in the [GOV.UK Prototype Kit](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-prototype-kit-private-beta) to speed up prototyping.

  To include global styles, you can set `$govuk-global-styles` variable to `true`.
