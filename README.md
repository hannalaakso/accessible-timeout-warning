=====================

GOV.UK Frontend contains the code you need to start building a user interface
for government platforms and services.

See live examples of GOV.UK Frontend components, and guidance on when to use
them in your service, in the [GOV.UK Design
System](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/).

## Contact the team

GOV.UK Frontend is maintained by a team at Government Digital Service. If you want to know more about GOV.UK Frontend, please email the [Design System
team](mailto:govuk-design-system-support@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk) or get in touch with them on [Slack](https://ukgovernmentdigital.slack.com/messages/govuk-design-system).

## Quick start

There are 2 ways to start using GOV.UK Frontend in your app.

Once installed, you will be able to use the code from the examples in the
[GOV.UK Design System](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/)
in your service.

### 1. Install with npm (recommended)

We recommend [installing GOV.UK Frontend using node package manager
(npm)](docs/installation/installing-with-npm.md).

### 2. Install by using compiled files

You can also [download the compiled and minified assets (CSS, JavaScript) from
GitHub](docs/installation/installing-from-dist.md).

## Browser support

GOV.UK Frontend will allow you to build services that comply with the [guidance
in the Service Manual][service-manual-browsers].

Currently, GOV.UK Frontend officially supports the following browsers:

| Operating system | Browser                                | Support     |
|----------------- |----------------------------------------|-------------|
| Windows          | Internet Explorer 8-10                 | functional  |
| Windows          | Internet Explorer 11                   | compliant   |
| Windows          | Edge (latest 2 versions)               | compliant   |
| Windows          | Google Chrome (latest 2 versions)      | compliant   |
| Windows          | Mozilla Firefox (latest 2 versions)    | compliant   |
| macOS            | Safari 9+                              | compliant   |
| macOS            | Google Chrome (latest 2 versions)      | compliant   |
| macOS            | Mozilla Firefox (latest 2 versions)    | compliant   |
| iOS              | Safari for iOS 9.3+                    | compliant   |
| iOS              | Google Chrome (latest 2 versions)      | compliant   |
| Android          | Google Chrome (latest 2 versions)      | compliant   |
| Android          | Samsung Internet (latest 2 versions)   | compliant   |

‘Compliant’ means that the components must look as good and function as well as
they do in other modern browsers.

'Functional' means the components may not look perfect in the given browser, but
must still be usable without errors and without 'looking broken'.

If you are including GOV.UK Frontend as part of a stylesheet that you are
generating in your application's build pipeline, you will need to [generate and
include a separate stylesheet in order to support Internet Explorer
8](docs/installation/supporting-internet-explorer-8.md).

Currently, GOV.UK Frontend officially supports the following assistive technologies:

| Software                 | Version        | Type               | Browser                   |
|--------------------------|----------------|--------------------|---------------------------|

In addition, we test that all content is accessible with keyboard only.

We aim to support [users who adjust or override the colours of websites they visit][how-users-change-colours-on-websites]. We test this by [changing colours in Firefox][changing-colours-in-firefox], by [enabling 'High Contrast' mode in Windows][enabling-high-contrast-mode-in-windows] and by using the [High Contrast plugin for Chrome][high-contrast-plugin-for-chrome].
